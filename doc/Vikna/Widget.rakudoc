=NAME

C<Vikna::Widget> - the base of all widgets

=DESCRIPTION

The class provides the foundation for all drawable Vikna classes. It binds together event and command event handling,
parent/child relations, canvas, color and attribute management. On top of it all it implements basic APIs for drawing,
sizing/positioning, and event-driven behaviors.

=head2 Flattening Canvas

After a widget has drawn itself Vikna takes a number of step to ensure it is imprinted correctly on its parent and,
eventually, on the screen. The process is called I<flattening> because figuratively it could be described as if
Z-order of children canvas is flattened down into parent's canvas. Here is how this happens.

Many good stories starts from the end. This one does it too. Let's skip all preceding steps and say that widget sends
it's ready canvas (BTW, it is internally called imPrinted canvas and abbreviated to just C<pcanvas>) and all current
invalidations (converted into parent's coordinate system) to the parent. At this point widget's work is over and it
clears all invalidations. The next cycle starts now.

Meanwhile, the parent receives C<Event::Cmd::ChildCanvas> and records the received object in its local registry. The
invalidations which came with the command event are appended to the list of local invalidations. This is where the
story starts because the parent immediately initiates the I<flattening>. From this moment on we stop using term
I<parent> and using just I<widget> again.

The first step is checking if the flattening is not blocked for a reason. If so, we increase flatten miss counter and
leave. When all blockers are done, the framework checks the counter and initiates immediate flattening.

Now, we need to prepare C<pcanvas>. Normally, if widget dimensions are not changed, C<pcanvas> is preserved across
flattening cycles and only updated using invalidations. It somewhat speeds up the flattening process by avoiding
extra object allocations and copying of full canvas content each time, especially if only tiny bits of widget are
updated.

If there is no block installed, then currently active invalidations are applied to C<pcanvas>. Then widget imprints
own canvas on C<pcanvas> and all collected children canvas from the local registry unless a child is invisible. It
means that if a child was created and attached but never sent its canvas up to the parent â€“ it would never be displayed.

Children are also get notified of their canvas is used with C<Event::Updated>.

Once again, note that imprinting will only change the areas of the widget which were invalidated either by the widget
itself or by mapped invalidations from children. A good example of how it works would be the following scheme:

    ...............
    .. Label ......
    ...............

The dots represent a parent widget with a L<C<Vikna::Label>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Label.md> child attached. Then, say, we change the label text. No
other changes were done. Then the only area on C<pcanvas> which will be affected by flattening will be the one-line
rectangle at C<(x:2, y:1, w:7, h:1)> granted that text change doesn't change label's dimentions. If the parent widget
is really big this optimization would save us a whole lot copying over! Moreover, the invalidation will then be
propagated further upstream resulting in the same little changes done in all parents up until the desktop and screen
themselve.

At this point flattening down of canvas is almost done. If widget has a parent, it invokes C<child-canvas> command
method on it with C<pcanvas> and mapped invalidations.

If the widget is the top one (i.e. the desktop) then it calls command method C<print> with C<pcanvas>. C<Event::Updated>
is then sent to self as if our parent notified us of imprint taken place.

And so, the story closes the cycle...

=head2 Redraw Hold

Drawing is probably one of the slowest operations happening inside the framework. Thus, it's not so uncommon for a
widget to receive a redraw request while another redraw is already in progress. Moreover, there could be few or even
more than just few requests sent before the current redraw finishes. Without taking special care of such situation,
there is high risk of redraws stacking up and blocking any other event activity on the widget.

To prevent such bottlenecks, widgets installs an event filter for C<Event::Cmd::Redraw> (see C<send-event> in
L<C<Vikna::EventHandling>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/EventHandling.md>.
The filter does two things depending on whether another redraw operation is currently active or now:

=item if no active redraw, it is bypasses the event but installs a C<then> hook on event's completion L<C<Promise>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Promise>
=item otherwise the new redraw request attempted to be put on hold. If there is no previous hold is held then the
current request is recorded and released when the active redraw completes. But if there is a hold already then current
request event is dropped

When a hold is released the event held is re-dispatched using C<re-dispatch> method with C<PrioReleased> priority which
gives the event preference over many other events and therefore reasonably speeding up system reaction to updates.

=head2 Widget As A Hash

A widget object supports hash-like access to its children. For example:

    $widget<Button0>

would return a child named I<"Button0"> if one exists. I<Nil> otherwise. Similarly

    $widget<Button0>:delete

detaches the child. So, basically:

    $widget1.add-child: $widget<Button0>:delete

is a re-parenting operation.

=ATTRIBUTES

=head3 L<C<Vikna::Rect:D>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Rect.md> C<$.geom>

Widget geometry in its parent coordinate system.

=head3 L<C<Vikna::Rect>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Rect.md> C<$.viewport>

Visible part of the widget in its parent coordinate system. To be more precise, this is widget's C<$.geom> clipped by
parent's viewport. In the scheme below 1 is our viewport area. It might be even smaller if the parent itself isn't fully
visible.

=begin code
               +---------+
    +---- Parent ----+   |
    |          |  1  | 2 |
    |          +-----|---+
    +----------------+
=end code

=head3 L<C<Vikna::Rect>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Rect.md> C<$.abs-geom>

Widget geometry in absolute coordinate system. By I<absolute> we take the screen, but because the desktop object is
assumed to occupy the whole screen, all absolute coordinates are taken relatively to desktop.

=head3 L<C<Vikna::Rect>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Rect.md> C<$.abs-viewport>

Similar to C<$.abs-geom>, but for C<$.viewport>.

=head3 L<C<Vikna::WAttr:D>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/WAttr.md> C<$.attr>

Widget default attributes.

=head3 C<Bool:D $.auto-clear>

If I<True> then every new draw operation starts with a fresh canvas. Otherwise new canvas get its content from the
last draw operation.

=head3 C<Bool:D $.hidden>

If I<True> then widget is intentionally hidden on its parent.

=head3 C<Bool:D $.invisible>

If I<True> then widget is outside of parent's viewport and thus not visible on the screen. The difference with
C<$.hidden> attribute is that the latter is set intentionally, while this attribute is a result of calculations of
widget position.

=head3 L<C<Vikna::Canvas>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Canvas.md> C<$.canvas>

Widget canvas after the last redraw operation.

=head3 L<C<Promise:D>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Promise> C<$.initialized>

This promise is kept when a widget init stage is fully completed, including the first redraw.

=head3 L<C<Promise:D>|https://docs.raku.org/type/Promise> C<$.dismissed>

This promise is kept with I<True> when widget has shutdown. In particular, its event loop has been stopped.

=head3 C<@.invalidations>

List of invalidation rectangles. Is used for the next redraw operation and cleared after flattened down canvas were
sent over to the parent.

=METHODS

=head2 General Purpose Methods

=head3 C<submethod profile-checkin(%profile, $constructor, %, %)>

The default widget profile checkin is responsible for the following operations:

=item it converts C<x>, C<y>, C<w>, C<h> profile keys into C<geom> by creating a new
L<C<Vikna::Rect>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Rect.md> instance unless C<geom> is defined explicitly
=item it converts C<fg>, C<bg>, C<style>, and C<pattern> profile keys into C<attr> by creating a new
L<C<Vikna::WAttr>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/WAttr.md> instance

All mentioned above source keys are unconditionally deleted from C<%profile>.

=head3 C<create-child(Vikna::Widget:U \widgetType, ChildStrata $stratum = StMain, *%p)>

Create a new widget child. The child is created detached and C<Event::Init> is dispatched on it instantly. Then it is
added to the widget with C<add-child> method.

Returns the child object.

=head3 C<subscribe-to-child(Vikna::Widget:D $child)>

Method subscribes self to child events and passes them to widget's C<child-event> handler method.

=head3 C<multi route-event(Event::Spreadable:D $ev)>

Re-dispatches C<$ev> to child widgets.

=head3 C<multi child-event(Event:D)>

Proto defined to handle children events if subscribed to a child. By default does nothing.

=head3 C<subscription-event(Event:D $ev)>

Proto defined to handle any other subscription events. By default does nothing.
See L<C<Vikna::EventHandling>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/EventHandling.md> role.

=head3 C<flatten-canvas()>

Normally one doesn't need this method except special care is required to guarantee correct imprinting of a object on
its parent.

See L<#Canvas Flattening> section above.

=head3 C<multi get-child(Str:D $name)>
=head3 C<multi get-child(Int:D $id)>

Returns a child widget by its C<$name> or C<$id>.

=head3 C<Bool()>

Coerces a widget into boolean. Returns C<True> unless widget is closed.

=head3 C<Str()>

Returns widget's name.

=head3 C<gist()>

Stringifies widget to C<$.id ~ ":" ~ $.name>.

=head2 Command Methods

This is a group of methods which sends command events to the widget. Normally they're just shortcuts for
L<C<Vikna::CommandHandling>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/CommandHandling.md>
C<send-command> method.

Because command methods are what user must interact with, C<cmd-*> methods are not documented as they're
implementation detail. Where relevant, their behaviors will be elaborated on in description of command methods.

=head3 C<add-child(Vikna::Widget:D $child, ChildStrata $stratum = StMaian, :$subscribe = True)>

C<Event::Cmd::AddChild>. Adds a new child to the widget. This includes subscribtion to child events if C<$subscribe>
is I<True>.

Upon successfull addition C<Event::Attached> is dipatched on both the child and self. If the added child becomes
the topmost one on strata, C<Event::ZOrder::Top> is dispatched on the child and C<Event::ZOrder::Child> on self.

=head3 C<remove-child($child)>

C<Event::Cmd::RemoveChild>. Removes a child from the widget children list. Emits C<Event::Detached> on the child.

A child could be removed from its parent for two reasons: either it is closing or it is switching to another parent.
The command considers both situation. If the child is closing, then the widget awaits until it becomes C<$.dismissed>
before finalizing the removal. Otherfile finalization takes place immediately.

The finalization of child removal does:

=item dispatches C<Event::Detached> on self
=item redraws the widget to update the area previously occupied by the child.

Corresponding C<Event::ZOrder::*> events are dispatched if necessary.

=head3 C<child-canvas(Vikna::Widget:D $child, Vikna::Rect:D $canvas-geom, Vikna::Canvas::D $canvas, @invlidations)>

C<Event::Cmd::ChildCanvas>. Register updated child canvas on the widget. Must not be used by user code normally.

Part of the L<#Canvas Flattening> process. A child sends this command every time its own C<pcanvas> is updated.

=head3 C<redraw()>

C<Event::Cmd::Redraw>. Request the widget to redraw itself. The action might not happen in on of the cases:

=item when widget is C<$.invisible>
=item if redraws are blocked on the widget (see C<redraw-block> method)
=item if the widget doesn't have any invalidations registered

When drawing is possible, new canvas is created by C<begin-draw> method and passed to widget method C<draw>. When it's
done C<end-draw> is invoked with the same canvas object which is then set as widget's C<$.canvas>. At the end widget
flattens canvas, as described in L<#Canvas Flattening>.

At the widget first ever redraw C<$.initialized> is kept and C<Event::InitDone> is dispatched.

C<Event::Redrawn> is dispatched always.

=head3 C<to-top(Vikna::Widget:D $child)>

C<Event::Cmd::To::Top>. Sends a C<$child> to the top of Z-order within it's stratum. Then invalidates the rectangle
occupied by the child and flattens canvas.

C<Event::ZOrder::Top> is dispatched on the child, C<Event::ZOrder::Child> is dispatched on self.

=head3 C<maybe-to-top()>

Normally does nothing. It is used by L<C<Vikna::Elevatable>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Elevatable.md>
role to signal to a widget it is applied to there is an event happened to which the widget can respond by elevating
itself to the top of Z-order.

For example see L<C<Vikna::Window>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Window.md>.

=head3 C<clear()>

C<Event::Cmd::Clear>. The command is bypassed down to widget children too. Then fully invalidates and redraws the
widget.

=head3 C<resize($w, $h)>

Shortcut for C<set-geom> method with preserved widget coordinates.

=head3 C<move($x, $y)>

Shortcut for C<set-geom> method with preserved widget dimensions

=head3 C<multi set-geom($x, $y, $w, $h)>
=head3 C<multi set-geom(Vikna::Rect:D $geom)>

C<Event::Cmd::SetGeom>. Method changes widget geometry on its parent. It has the following side effects:

=item widget position information is updated by C<update-positions> method.
=item widget is invalidated as a whole
=item the old widget rectangle is invalidated on its parent
=item position information is updated on children
=item widget redraw is initiated

C<Event::Changed::Geom> is dispatched on self if the requested geometry differs from the previous one.

=head3 C<set-color(:$fg, :$bg)>

C<Event::Cmd::SetColor>. Changes widget default foreground/background colors. Throws C<X::BadColor> if any of the two is
invalid. Dispatches C<Event::Changed::Color>.

=head3 C<set-style(|c)>

C<Event::Cmd::SetStyle>. Changes widget default style. Takes same arguments as C<to-style> routine from
L<C<Vikna::Utils>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Utils.md>. Dispatches C<Event::Changed::Style>.

=head3 C<multi set-attr(Vikna::CAttr:D $attr)>
=head3 C<multi set-attr(*%c)>

C<Event::Cmd::SetAttr>. Changes default widget attributes. In a way we can say it combines C<set-color> and C<set-style>
method calls. Dispatches C<Event::Changed::Attr>.

=head3 C<set-bg-pattern($pattern)>

C<Event::Cmd::SetBgPatter>. Changes the default widget background patter. Dispatches C<Event::Changed::BgPattern> and
initiates full widget redraw.

=head3 C<set-hidden($hidden)>, C<hide()>, C<show()>

C<Event::Cmd::SetHidden>. Set widget hidden status. C<hide()> and C<show()> are aliases to C<self.set-hidden(True)> and
C<self.set-hidden(False)> respectively. Dispatches C<Event::Hide>, C<Event::Show>. If widget C<$.visible> status changes
then additionally could dispatch C<Event::Visible> or C<Event::Invisible>.

=head3 C<nop()>

C<Event::Cmd::Nop>. No operation.

=head3 C<sync-events(:$transitive)>

This method ensures that all previously dispatched events were handled by the event loop. With event priorities in mind,
this rule doesn't apply to C<PrioIdle> events.

Technically, the method invokes C<nop>. If C<$transitive> then it also does so on children widgets. C<Event::Cmd::Nop>
instances are collected and their completion promises are all awaited.

There is a timeout of 30 seconds. If at least one event fails to complete withing the time frame then the method invokes
C<self.panic> with C<X::AdHoc>.

=head3 C<contains(Vikna::Coord:D $obj, :$absolute)>

C<Event::Cmd::Contains>. The completion promise of the event returned by the method will contain a boolean reporting
whether the object C<$obj> is contained within widget's geometry. With C<:absolute> the C<$obj> is expected to be
defined in terms of the desktop coordinates.

=head3 C<close()>

C<Event::Cmd::Close>. Close the widget.

Firs, the command is bypassed down to the widget children. C<Event::Closing> is dispatched on self. Then the widget
awaits for all children to dismiss and when they have detaches itself from the parent. Then see C<detach> method
description.

=head3 C<quit()>

Shortcut for quitting the whole application. A child widget invokes C<quit> method on the desktop. The desktop closes
itself.

=head3 C<detach()>

If the widget has a parent then invokes C<remove-child> on it for self. Otherwise the widget is the desktop, method only
dispatches C<Event::Detached> on self with event C<child> attribute set to C<self>.

=head3 C<shutdown()>

Stops event loop. Then keeps C<$.dismissed> with I<True>.

=head3 C<panic($cause)>

Causes the whole application to bail out. C<$cause> is an exception explaining the cause of the panic.

=head2 State Methods

Methods reporting current widget state

=head3 C<visible()>

Returns true if widget is visible on the parent.

=head3 C<closed()>

Returns true if the widget is closed. Note that closing is a process consisting of several steps. It is not fully done
until C<$.dismissed> is kept.

=head2 Utility Methods

Methods in this category are oftem implementation details. Their purpose is provide automation for some common
operations.

=head3 C<set-invisible($invisible)>

Implementation detail. Must not be used normally.

=head3 C<update-positions(:$transitive)>

Method recalculates widget C<$.viewport>, C<$.abs-geom>, and C<$.abs-viewport>. Because it operates directly on the
widget status must not be invoked from outside of the event loop.

With C<:transitive> updates all children positions recursively.

Sets widget visibility status.

=head3 C<add-inv-parent-rect(Vikna::Rect:D $rect)>

Add invalidation rectangle C<$rect> to be submitted up to the parent upon canvas flattening.

=head3 C<add-inv-rect(Vikna::Rect:D $rect)>

Adds an invalidation rectangle. Also recalculates it into parent's coordinate system and passes the result to
C<add-inv-parent-rect()> method.

=head3 C<clear-invalidations()>

Deletes all local invalidations. Those stashed for parent are left intact.

=head3 C<multi invalidate(Vikna::Rect:D $rect)>
=head3 C<multi invalidate(Int:D $x, Int:D $y, Dimention $w, Dimention $h)>
=head3 C<multi invalidate(Int:D :$x, Int:D :$y, Dimention :$w, Dimention :$h)>
=head3 C<multi invalidate(@invalidations)>

Invalidate rectangles on self. Invokes C<add-inv-rect> method.

=head3 C<multi invalidate()>

Invalidates the entire widget.

=head3 C<begin-draw(Vikna::Canvas $canvas? --> Vikna::Canvas)>

Must not be used outside of the event loop.

Start draw operation. If not passed with a canvas object then creates a new one of the size of the widget. If
C<$.auto-clear> is I<False> then new canvas gets its content from C<$.canvas>. Otherwise an empty one is created and
entire widget is invalidated. The new canvas gets all invalidations so far applied to the widget.

Method returns the prepared canvas object.

=head3 C<end-draw(:$canvas!)>

Currently does nothing but invoked by the default C<draw> method. Can be used by a descendant class to take necessary
actions when drawing is over.

Invalidates a rectangle.

=head3 C<draw(Vikna::Canvas:D :$canvas)>

This is the method a child class must override to draw itself. By default only invokes C<draw-background> method.

=head3 C<draw-background(Vikna::Canvas:D :$canvas)>

Draws default widget background using C<$.attr.pattern>. If pattern is not defined then this is a noop.

=head3 C<redraw-block()>, C<redraw-unblock()>, C<redraw-hold(&code, |c)>

Define boundaries of no-redraw zone. Nested, i.e. to re-enable drawing one must call C<redraw-unblock> as many times
as C<redraw-block>s were called. Transitive operation.

When the last C<redraw-unblock> is invoked, widget attempts to release any postponed redraw event:

    self.redraw-block;
    self.invalidate;
    self.redraw; # Nothing happens
    self.redraw-unblock; # Event::Cmd::Redraw is released.

Extra unblocking results in C<X::OverUnblock> thrown.

Use of C<redraw-hold> method is recommended whenever possible. I.e. the above example is better be written as:

    self.redraw-hold: {
        self.invalidate;
        self.redraw;
    }

It is possible to pass a sub to C<redraw-hold> and submit its arguments alongside:

    self.redraw-hold: &do-many-things, 42, "is The Answer";

=head3 C<flatten-block()>, C<flatten-unblock()>, C<flatten-hold(&code, |c)>

Similar to C<redraw-block> family of methods but block canvas flattening.

=head3 C<multi cursor(Vikna::Point:D $pos)>
=head3 C<multi cursor(Int:D $x, Int:D $y)>

Positions cursor on the screen.

=head3 C<hide-cursor()>, C<show-cursor()>

Hide or show the cursor.

=head3 C<event-filer(Event::Cmd::Redraw:D $ev)>

Implements redraw hold. See
L<C<Vikna::EventHandling>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/EventHandling.md>
C<send-event> method and L<#Redraw Hold> section of this page.

=head3 C<next-sibling(:$loop = False, :$on-strata = False)>
=head3 C<prev-sibling(:$loop = False, :$on-strata = False)>

Returns our next or preceding sibling in Z-order on parent. See C<:loop> and C<:on-strata> parameters on C<next-to>
method of L<C<Vikna::Parent>|https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/v0.0.3/docs/md/Vikna/Parent.md>.
